## 💀 Project Overview
A sophisticated OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) tool designed to automate the scanning of the **Department of Justice (DOJ)** database. It utilizes a hybrid `Selenium` + `Requests` engine to bypass CAPTCHA protections and perform multi-threaded searches for specific targets within the **Epstein Files Transparency Act** library.

**Features:**
* 🕵️ **Session Hijacking:** Uses a headless browser to authorize a secure session.
* ⚡ **Pulse Engine:** Multi-threaded API scanning for maximum speed.
* 🖥️ **Hacker UI:** Custom "Fsociety" terminal aesthetic with matrix-style effects.
* 📂 **Data Exfiltration:** Automatically extracts and logs direct PDF download links.
